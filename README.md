# Arithematic Logic Unit
ALU is a processor unit which performs the task
of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In order to
support CPU for its arithmatic and logical processes, ALU has
AU (i.e) arithmatic unit and LU (i.e) Logical Unit. This paper
deals with its analysis and functioning of this important unit of
CPU using verilog.
# Introduction
An arithmatic logic unit is an important part of central
processing unit and performs arithmatic and logic operations.
It can take inputs as multiple bits through an input register.
It is the fundamental building block of the central processing
unit of a computer.The ALU is the mathematical brain of a
computer. The first ALU was INTEL 74181 implemented as
a 7400 series is a TTL integrated circuit that was released in
1970.[1]
